# Wazuh-repo
This repository serves as a central hub for my activities, research, and community contributions as part of the Wazuh Ambassador Program. It includes documentation, deployment scripts, integration projects, event materials, and collaborative initiatives aimed at strengthening the Wazuh community in the Arab region.
